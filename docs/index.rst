	Project development is a hard and expensive process. If a project is small and a couple of people work on it, there will be no
	communication problem between them. But when the projects get larger and larger, communication between its members also getting hard.
	In order to solve this communication problem and make project creation process easier we created a web application named ProjectEasy. This project aims
	to create a great communication between project members and deal with arrangement of project tasks.
