======================================
Welcome to the user guide. In this guide I will show you how to use ProjectEasy pages. When you first enter to the website
you will see the login screen(Fig 1.1). There is no "Sign Up" because system admin can only add companies and after that companies log in to the system 
and they create their own employees.

	Login Page.
	
If you want to create a company you need admin account to do that job. You can reach create company menu only after you logged in as admin
After logged in, you can click create company menu on the topbar and reach the creation page(Fig 1.2).

	Create Company Page.

When you fill the form and click submit, company will be created. But also a user with the type of the company will be created.
Its username will be the name of the company, and its password will be the password that you have just entered. If you want to see
all companies you can click on the "List Companies" button(Fig 1.3).

	List Company Page

If you want to delete or alter a company you can click "Alter company" menu(Fig 1.4). You need to write company name to change 
its properties or delete it. After you write the name of the company you can go update page by clicking update button or you can
delete it from the database by clicking delete button.

	Alter Company Page

Finally you can click to "Logout" button to logout from the system.

You can now login to the system as a company that you have created before.
When you log in as a company you can add employee accounts to the system through "Add Employee" menu(Fig 1.5). When you fill the form and
click submit button system will create a username and password for the employee so employee can be log in to the system by using
those username and password.

	Add Employee Page
	
You can also change user information through "List Employee" menu. If you click delete next to employee that you want to delete, 
the employee will be deleted from the system. You can also click to the update button next to employee. After that you can alter 
the employee by the form next to it. If you want to include an employee into a project, you can select a project from the dropdown list.
If you do not include him in a project at the creation, you can include it by update menu later(Fig 1.6).
